# Credisomnia DeFi Platform - Comprehensive Analysis & Feature Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Platform Vision**: Credisomnia is an innovative DeFi platform that revolutionizes credit scoring and lending through blockchain technology. The platform creates an on-chain credit reputation system using soulbound NFTs, enables credit-based lending with dynamic collateral ratios, and provides savings mechanisms that contribute to credit score improvement.

**Core Innovation**: The platform's key differentiator is its dynamic credit scoring system that considers multiple factors (repayment history, savings activity, staking behavior, and payment consistency) to provide personalized lending terms and collateral requirements.

**Current State**: The platform has a solid foundation with core lending, savings, and credit scoring functionality implemented, but significant opportunities exist for expansion into advanced DeFi features, governance, and user experience enhancements.
