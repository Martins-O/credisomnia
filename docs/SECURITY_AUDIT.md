    return; // Skip update if too frequent
}

// Authorized contract validation
require(
    authorizedContracts[msg.sender] || hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender),
    "CreditOracle: Caller not authorized"
);
```

**Interest Calculation Validation**:
```solidity
// Safe interest calculation with bounds checking
uint256 interestEarned = currentBalance
    .mul(interestRate)
    .mul(blocksPassed)
    .div(BLOCKS_PER_YEAR)
    .div(10000);

// Reserve balance validation
if (reserveBalance >= newInterest) {
    reserveBalance = reserveBalance.sub(newInterest);
}
```

### ✅ Lending Pool Security (`LendingPool.sol`)

**Comprehensive Lending Security**:

1. **Loan Origination Security**:
   - ✅ Credit score validation through Oracle
   - ✅ Collateral requirement calculations
   - ✅ Loan eligibility verification
   - ✅ Liquidity availability checks

2. **Liquidation Protection**:
   - ✅ Health factor monitoring
   - ✅ Automated liquidation triggers
   - ✅ Liquidation bonus calculations
   - ✅ Remaining collateral return to borrower

3. **Interest Rate Security**:
   - ✅ Utilization-based rate calculations
   - ✅ Credit score risk premium integration
   - ✅ Maximum rate caps to prevent exploitation
   - ✅ Time-based interest accrual validation

**Liquidation Logic Verification**:
```solidity
// Health factor calculation with proper precision
uint256 healthFactor = loan.collateralAmount
    .mul(liquidationThreshold)
    .mul(1e18)
    .div(totalDebt)
    .div(10000);

// Liquidation trigger validation
return healthFactor < 1e18; // Below 100% health factor
```

## 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment

### ❌ No Critical Vulnerabilities Found

**Common DeFi Vulnerabilities Assessed**:

1. **✅ Reentrancy Attacks**: 
   - All state-changing functions protected with ReentrancyGuard
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed

2. **✅ Integer Overflow/Underflow**:

   - Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow checks

3. **✅ Access Control Issues**:
   - Comprehensive role-based access control
   - Proper authorization checks on sensitive functions

4. **✅ Price Manipulation**:
   - No external price oracles dependency
   - Credit scoring based on on-chain activities

5. **✅ Flash Loan Attacks**:
